# MathematicalModelling
A visual / terminal output of time-dependent variables given by initial conditions. 

The visual output uses Pygame to display the displacement, velocity and acceleration over time.

Current setup is modelling a falling object, and is using PID control to add "thrust" to keep the object at a goal height of 500 (Green line)
The other horizontal lines refer to the 0-points of each respective graph.
